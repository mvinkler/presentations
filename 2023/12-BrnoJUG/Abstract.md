# Abstract

Openshift Serverless Functions fall somewhere between a CaaS (Containers-as-a-Service) and a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) and provide an experience similar to Google Functions or Azure Container Apps. Those platforms allow you to run your applications without the need to know about containers or Kubernetes. They take source code, often just a function, and convert it into a runnable artifact, deployed on a cluster, while hiding from you all of the Kubernetes and container details.

In this talk, you will learn about Openshift Serverless Functions: what they are and how you can use them to quickly and easily deploy event-driven, Serverless applications. We will focus on Quarkus runtime and its Funqy API which helps to write functions deployable to various FaaS environments. The session will also explain the ease of using the new abstracted Cloud Event technology as a bus for driving events to Serverless applications.
